# Superhero Room Database Example

This is a room database of superheros with some predefined superheros and an option to add new superheros. Details which include name , description , height , weight , speed , strength , intelligence etc. are provided in the database. App is a perfect example to learn how to create the database and show that data through graphs and textViews. It also teaches how to load data from the database and save images in the database through Base64 string encoding and decoding. This app uses libraries like Glide which makes the scrolling of recyclerview smooth even though recyclerview gets its data(Images) from the database directly. App uses kotlin coroutines to perform any database transaction and other heavy work.
